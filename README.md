# _**FUTURE STUDENTS DOING COMP307:**_

If you are viewing my code to do the first assignment for this course, I hope it makes sense and is useful for guidance and referencing.

- Please do **NOT** copy-paste/plagarise my code. You will get penalised by _**ECS**_ and _**VUW**_.

# _**OTHER VIEWERS**_

This code was written in a way that anyone that is new to coding can understand it. 
There are many codestyle issues with this code **i.e.,** some boiler-plate code, bad coding practice,
missing/not updated Javadoc, spacing, etc. To-be-honest, I don't care too much as this is for an assignment,
and we were not being marked for our style. I was also out of time. 

- _**So, I'm sorry to any advanced programmers out there looking at my crap code. :)**_
